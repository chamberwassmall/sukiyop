		<p><strong>Text Mining In R</strong>. Text must be cleaned before the analysis modeling and visualization stages. In particular we start with common text transformations perform various data explorations with term frequency tf and inverse document frequency idf and build a supervised classifiaction model that learns the difference between texts of different authors. The texts used in this example are a few of Donald Trumps speeches that were copied and pasted into a text document. Text manipulation is costly in terms of either coding or running or both.</p>
